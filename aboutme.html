    <1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Am working towards in my personal and professional life is to own my own company. Some experiences that led me here is seeing some big companies being successful and makes items that is making them a lot of money. Another experience is seeing people manage their companies by telling them ideas for the company and how they can make the company expand so they can make more money and let people know about the company. 
Am working towards these goals by observing companies and how they manage them. Another way is going on the internet and searching about how to start a company and what type of companies would become successful. 
Some values I consider most necessary for my success is working hard and always doing the right thing. Another value is being able to accomplish in what I need to succeed. 
One short time goal I hope to accomplish in the near future is being able to save up money so that I can invest it in making a company. Another short time goal is to focus on one thing at a time. 
One character trait I want to be know for is being a hard-working person and never giving up. Another trait is always being on time and never letting anybody down.</p>
